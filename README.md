# SlowLorris DDoS Attack C++
This is an improvement of [This repository](https://github.com/vsouda/SlowLorisDDoSAttackCPP)

# What's changed?
This "improved" version should fix some of the C++11 depenant and outdated features - such as trying to create a variable size array, which now is done by pushing threadArray to a vector & implementing vector iterators for loops - Whilst adding other general code improvements, like making it platform independant.
